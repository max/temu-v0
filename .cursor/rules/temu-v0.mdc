This is a project using Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and React. It is used as a prototyping environment for front-end experiences.

- Use prebuilt components from the shadcn/ui library after it is imported: `import { alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle, AlertDialog, AlertDialogAction } from '@/components/ui/alert'`;.
- To get a sense of which components exist look in `./src/components`.
- When installing npm packages, use the provided installPackage and removePackage commands.
- Ensure that React components use Tailwind CSS for styling. Minimize use of CSS in CSS files (but use it where necessary).
- Use functional React components as much as possible, with hooks where necessary.
- Where complex state handling is needed, favor use of React context over installing state management packages.
- See package.json to see packages already installed.
- If the user asks you to persist things, favor simple local storage solutions over more durable options.
